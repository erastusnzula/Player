Player is a project that lets you play your favorite videos and audios conveniently.
It supports all major video and audio file extensions such as mp4, mp3, wav, vob etc. The player 
automatically loads all audio and video files in  a directory, sparing you the hectic of manually
adding a single file at a time. The player also accommodates all play modes, repeat, shuffle and descending
mode. The player presents you with an easy-to-use interface and buttons that performs all player 
functionalities as shown below.
